The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The star schema is named as such because of the resemblence of its physical model to a star. A fact table is at the middle and is surrounded by dimension tables, the points of the star. Facts hold the measurable, quantitative data about a business while dimensions are descriptive attributes related to fact data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following MRJob code, implements a reduce-side join for an inner join. The reducer is almost stateless, i.e., uses as little memory as possible. Use the tables from HW5.2 for this HW and join based on the country code (third column of the transactions table and the second column of the Countries table perform.

    "__Some notes on the code__ \n",
    "Here, the mapper receives its set of input splits either from the transaction table or from the countries table and makes the appropriate transformations: splitting the line into fields, and emitting a key/value. The key is the join key - in this case, the country code field of both sets of records. The mapper knows which file and type of record it is receiving based on the length of the fields. The records it emits contain the join field as the key, which acts as the partitioning key; We use the SORT_VALUES option, which ensures the values are sorted as well. Then, we employ a trick to ensure that for each join key, country records are seen always before transaction records. We achieve this by adding an arbitrary key to the front of the value: 'A' for countries, 'B' for customers. This makes countries sort before customers for each and every join/partition key. After that trick, the join is simply a matter of storing countries ('A' records) and crossing this array with each customer record."
